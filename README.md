## Overview

This is the official website for the Birding Club at the University of Virginia. Join us for birding trips, education, and community.

## Deployment

The project is hosted at:

**[https://birdingatuva.vercel.app](https://birdingatuva.vercel.app)**

## Run locally

These instructions assume you're on macOS using the default `zsh` shell. This project uses pnpm (see `package.json`).

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Build for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

3. Start the production server locally (after build):

```bash
pnpm start
```

4. Start the development server for rapid updates:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

If you use a different package manager (npm or yarn) tell me and I can add equivalent commands.
