## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.app](https://v0.app).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.app](https://v0.app).

## Deployment

Your project is live at:

**[https://vercel.com/rpt2fx-1361s-projects/v0-uva-bird-club-website](https://vercel.com/rpt2fx-1361s-projects/v0-uva-bird-club-website)**

## Build your app

Continue building your app on:

**[https://v0.app/chat/projects/7gbC7FHGHHI](https://v0.app/chat/projects/7gbC7FHGHHI)**

## How It Works

1. Create and modify your project using [v0.app](https://v0.app)
2. Deploy your chats from the v0 interface
3. Changes are automatically pushed to this repository
4. Vercel deploys the latest version from this repository

## Run locally

These instructions assume you're on macOS using the default `zsh` shell. This project uses pnpm (see `package.json`).

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Build for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

4. Start the production server locally (after build):

```bash
pnpm start
```

If you use a different package manager (npm or yarn) tell me and I can add equivalent commands.
